 * @brief  Lazy instantiation of specified type. Useful in conjunction with
 *         Michael Feathers's "Extract and Override Getter" ("Working
 *         Effectively with Legacy Code", p. 352).
 *
 * Quoting his synopsis of steps on p.355:
 *
 * 1. Identify the object you need a getter for.
 * 2. Extract all of the logic needed to create the object into a getter.
 * 3. Replace all uses of the object with calls to the getter, and initialize
 *    the reference that holds the object to null in all constructors.
 * 4. Add the first-time logic to the getter so that the object is constructed
 *    and assigned to the reference whenever the reference is null.
 * 5. Subclass the class and override the getter to provide an alternative
 *    object for testing.
 *
 * It's the second half of bullet 3 (3b, as it were) that bothers me. I find
 * it all too easy to imagine adding pointer initializers to all but one
 * constructor... the one not exercised by my tests. That suggested using
 * (e.g.) boost::scoped_ptr<MyObject> so you don't have to worry about
 * destroying it either.
 *
 * However, introducing additional machinery allows us to encapsulate bullet 4
 * as well.

/**
 * LLLazy<T> is useful when you have an outer class Outer that you're trying
 * to bring under unit test, that contains a data member difficult to
 * instantiate in a test harness. Typically the data member's class Inner has
 * many thorny dependencies. Feathers generally advocates "Extract and
 * Override Factory Method" (p. 350). But in C++, you can't call a derived
 * class override of a virtual method from the derived class constructor,
 * which limits applicability of "Extract and Override Factory Method." For
 * such cases Feathers presents "Extract and Override Getter" (p. 352).
 *
 * So we'll assume that your class Outer contains a member like this:
 * @code
 * Inner mInner;
 * @endcode
 *
 * LLLazy<Inner> can be used to replace this member. You can directly declare:
 * @code
 * LLLazy<Inner> mInner;
 * @endcode
 * and change references to mInner accordingly.
 *
 * (Alternatively, you can add a base class of the form
 * <tt>LLLazyBase<Inner></tt>. This is discussed further in the LLLazyBase<T>
 * documentation.)
 *
 * LLLazy<T> binds a <tt>boost::scoped_ptr<T></tt> and a factory functor
 * returning T*. You can either bind that functor explicitly or let it default
 * to the expression <tt>new T()</tt>.
 *
 * As long as LLLazy<T> remains unreferenced, its T remains uninstantiated.
 * The first time you use get(), <tt>operator*()</tt> or <tt>operator->()</tt>
 * it will instantiate its T and thereafter behave like a pointer to it.
 *
 * Thus, any existing reference to <tt>mInner.member</tt> should be replaced
 * with <tt>mInner->member</tt>. Any simple reference to @c mInner should be
 * replaced by <tt>*mInner</tt>.
 *
 * (If the original declaration was a pointer initialized in Outer's
 * constructor, e.g. <tt>Inner* mInner</tt>, so much the better. In that case
 * you should be able to drop in <tt>LLLazy<Inner></tt> without much change.)
 *
 * The support for "Extract and Override Getter" lies in the fact that you can
 * replace the factory functor -- or provide an explicit T*. Presumably this
 * is most useful from a test subclass -- which suggests that your @c mInner
 * member should be @c protected.
 *
 * Note that <tt>boost::lambda::new_ptr<T>()</tt> makes a dandy factory
 * functor, for either the set() method or LLLazy<T>'s constructor. If your T
 * requires constructor arguments, use an expression more like
 * <tt>boost::lambda::bind(boost::lambda::new_ptr<T>(), arg1, arg2, ...)</tt>.
 *
 * Of course the point of replacing the functor is to substitute a class that,
 * though referenced as Inner*, is not an Inner; presumably this is a testing
 * subclass of Inner (e.g. TestInner). Thus your test subclass TestOuter for
 * the containing class Outer will contain something like this:
 * @code
 * class TestOuter: public Outer
 * {
 * public:
 *     TestOuter()
 *     {
 *         // mInner must be 'protected' rather than 'private'
 *         mInner.set(boost::lambda::new_ptr<TestInner>());
 *     }
 *     ...
 * };
 * @endcode

/**
 * LLLazyBase<T> wraps LLLazy<T>, giving you an alternative way to replace
 * <tt>Inner mInner;</tt>. Instead of coding <tt>LLLazy<Inner> mInner</tt>,
 * you can add LLLazyBase<Inner> to your Outer class's bases, e.g.:
 * @code
 * class Outer: public LLLazyBase<Inner>
 * {
 *     ...
 * };
 * @endcode
 *
 * This gives you @c public get() and @c protected set() methods without
 * having to make your LLLazy<Inner> member @c protected. The tradeoff is that
 * you must access the wrapped LLLazy<Inner> using get() and set() rather than
 * with <tt>operator*()</tt> or <tt>operator->()</tt>.
 *
 * This mechanism can be used for more than one member, but only if they're of
 * different types. That is, you can replace:
 * @code
 * DifficultClass mDifficult;
 * AwkwardType    mAwkward;
 * @endcode
 * with:
 * @code
 * class Outer: public LLLazyBase<DifficultClass>, public LLLazyBase<AwkwardType>
 * {
 *     ...
 * };
 * @endcode
 * but for a situation like this:
 * @code
 * DifficultClass mMainDifficult, mAuxDifficult;
 * @endcode
 * you should directly embed LLLazy<DifficultClass> (q.v.).
 *
 * For multiple LLLazyBase bases, e.g. the <tt>LLLazyBase<DifficultClass>,
 * LLLazyBase<AwkwardType></tt> example above, access the relevant get()/set()
 * as (e.g.) <tt>LLLazyBase<DifficultClass>::get()</tt>. (This is why you
 * can't have multiple LLLazyBase<T> of the same T.) For a bit of syntactic
 * sugar, please see getLazy()/setLazy().

/**

 * {

 * };
 * @endcode
 *
 * Your methods can reference the @c DifficultClass instance using
 * <tt>LLLazyBase<DifficultClass>::get()</tt>, which is admittedly a bit ugly.
 * Alternatively, you can write <tt>getLazy<DifficultClass>(this)</tt>, which

 * @note
 * I wanted to provide getLazy() and setLazy() without explicitly passing @c
