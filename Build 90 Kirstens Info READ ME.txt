The artwork, scanner etc is licensed under BSD (My work )
DONT use the Latest LL KDU ( I have my own KDU )
Skype only works on REX servers! you require Skype4com libs to build
GCC on ubuntu 8.10 will require some minor changes to the code.
Mac builds may require some modification of Nib and resource files 

In BOTH cases don't expect clean and tidy builds!

Keep the versionviewer the same otherwise tracking whats screwing up becomes difficult if the build number is not known !

(this will also cause the Mac APP to screw up but can be worked around)

Openjpeg will NOT make this viewer set the world on fire (if your after performance on Linux but can't bring yourself to used anything but GPL your wasting your time)

This Build will compile (with some heavy tweaking) on MacOSX leopard, with Xcode & on Ubuntu 8.10

And thanks to all the really helpful 'Community' Spirted sorts who have made my life a misery, enjoy the source.

Love Kirsten
