	Event API

	LLLogin will issue multiple events to it pump to indicate the 
	progression of states through login. The most important 
	states are "offline" and "online" which indicate auth failure 
	and auth success respectively.

	pump: login (tweaked)
	These are the events posted to the 'login' 
	event pump from the login module.
	{
		state		:	string, // See below for the list of states.
		progress	:   real // for progress bar.
		data		:   LLSD // Dependent upon state.
	}
	
	States for method 'login_to_simulator'
	offline - set initially state and upon failure. data is the server response.
	srvrequest - upon uri rewrite request. no data.
	authenticating - upon auth request. data, 'attempt' number and 'request' llsd.
	downloading - upon ack from auth server, before completion. no data
	online - upon auth success. data is server response.


	Dependencies:
	pump: LLAres 
	LLLogin makes a request for a SRV record from the uri provided by the connect method.
	The following event pump should exist to service that request.
	pump name: LLAres
	request = {
		op : "rewriteURI"
		uri : string
		reply : string

	pump: LLXMLRPCListener
	The request merely passes the credentials LLSD along, with one additional 
	member, 'reply', which is the string name of the event pump to reply on.
