///
/// Clients call the findUrl() method on a string to locate the first
/// occurence of a supported Urls in that string. If findUrl() returns
/// true, the LLUrlMatch object will be updated to describe the Url
/// that was matched, including a label that can be used to hyperlink
/// the Url, an icon to display next to the Url, and a XUI menu that
/// can be used as a popup context menu for that Url.
///
/// New Url types can be added to the registry with the registerUrl
/// method. E.g., to add support for a new secondlife:///app/ Url.
///
/// Computing the label for a Url could involve a roundtrip request
/// to the server (e.g., to find the actual agent or group name).
/// As such, you can provide a callback method that will get invoked
/// when a new label is available for one of your matched Urls.
