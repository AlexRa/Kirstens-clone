 * @file lltexture.h
 * @brief LLTexture definition
 *
 *	This class acts as a wrapper for OpenGL calls.
 *	The goal of this class is to minimize the number of api calls due to legacy rendering
 *	code, to define an interface for a multiple rendering API abstraction of the UI
 *	rendering, and to abstract out direct rendering calls in a way that is cleaner and easier to maintain.
