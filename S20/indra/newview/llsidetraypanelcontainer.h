/**
* LLSideTrayPanelContainer class acts like LLTabContainer with invisible tabs.
* It is designed to make panel switching easier, avoid setVisible(TRUE) setVisible(FALSE)
* calls and related workarounds.
* use onOpen to open sub panel, pass the name of panel to open
* in key[PARAM_SUB_PANEL_NAME].
* LLSideTrayPanelContainer also implements panel navigation history - it allows to 
* open previous or next panel if navigation history is available(after user 
* has opened two or more panels). *NOTE - only back navigation is implemented so far.
