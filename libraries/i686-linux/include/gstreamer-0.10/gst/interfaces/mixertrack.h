/*
 * Naming:
 *
 * A track is a single input/output stream (e.g. line-in,
 * microphone, etc.). Channels are then single streams
 * within a track. A mono stream has one channel, a stereo
 * stream has two, etc.
 *
 * Input tracks can have 'recording' enabled, which means
 * that any input will be hearable into the speakers that
 * are attached to the output. Mute is obvious. A track
 * flagged as master is the master volume track on this
 * mixer, which means that setting this track will change
 * the hearable volume on any output.
